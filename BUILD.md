# Build Blockstream Green

## Build requirements

You need to have the following Android developer tools installed:

- "Android SDK Platform-tools" version 29.0.3 recommended
- "Android SDK Tools" version 26.1.1
- "Android SDK Build-tools" version 29.0.3

The above tools can be installed from the Android SDK manager.

## Clone the repo

`git clone https://github.com/Blockstream/green_android.git`

`cd green_android`

## How to build

#### Use the released native libraries (recommended):

The pre-built native libraries are the same versions used in the builds
published by GreenAddress. Gradle/Android Studio will automatically use the latest.

To download and update manually native libraries to the latest supported run:

`cd crypto && ./fetch_gdk_binaries.sh && cd ..`

#### Cross-compile the native libraries (advanced):

If you wish to make changes to the native libraries or would like to build
completely from source, you can compile
[gdk](https://github.com/Blockstream/gdk)
from its source code yourself.

This requires the "Android NDK" (version r23b recommended) from Android
developer tools, as well as [SWIG](http://www.swig.org/). Most Linux
distributions have SWIG available, on debian for example you can install it
using:

`sudo apt-get install swig`

You must set the environment variables `ANDROID_NDK` and `JAVA_HOME`
correctly, then run:

`cd crypto && ./prepare_gdk_clang.sh && cd ..`

If you get errors building please ensure your are using the recommended NDK
version.

#### Build the Android app

Run:

`./gradlew build`

This will build both release and debug builds.

You can speed up builds by limiting the tasks which run. Use:

`./gradlew --tasks`

To see a list of available tasks.

#### Rebuilding with docker (optional)

If you have docker configured and want to build the app in release mode
without having to set up an Android development environment, run:

```
cd contrib
docker build -t greenbits_docker .
docker run -v $PATH_TO_GREENBITS_REPO:/gb greenbits_docker
```

If you don't need to build the Docker image, you can instead run:

`docker pull greenaddress/android && docker run -v $PATH_TO_GREENBITS_REPO:/gb greenaddress/android`
